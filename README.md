## Description
- I developed this project for the HTTP 5204 Mobile Development course at at Humber College with Christine Bittle.
- In this project, I used MS SQL Server for DataBase, Web API for back-end service and React for front-end.
- This project user can create different tasks and declare priority, deadline and the time needed for the task. A task can be grouped into different categories.
There is a task board that users can see the list of tasks, sort and filter the list, and change the task states.
